# KIT_Masterthesis_Xenia_Schneider

This repository contains all materials related to the thesis "Optimizing Structural Properties and Self-Assembly Dynamics of Y-Shaped DNA-Nanomotifs", including the manuscript, figures, simulation input and output files, coarse-grained model code, and analysis scripts. It documents the full computational workflow from oxDNA simulations to coarse-grained modeling and Bayesian optimization of motif angular parameters, as well as analyses of phase separation behavior.
