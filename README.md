## **📂 Repository Structure**

This repository contains all scripts, workflows, and supplemental materials associated with the thesis.
Each folder corresponds to a major methodological component of the project.

### **1. `Nanomotif_Coarse_Graining/`**

Scripts for converting oxDNA trajectories into a coarse-grained bead–spring representation.

---

### **2. `Nanomotif_Bayes_Opt/`**

Bayesian Optimization framework for predicting bead–spring angle potentials.

---

### **3. `Nanomotif_Phase_Sep/`**

Simulation scripts for network formation and concentration-dependent phase separation.

---

### **4. `environment.yml`**

Conda environment file used to recreate the computational environment for all scripts.

To create the environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate readdy2
```

## **📊 Data Availability**

oxDNA trajectories and phase-separation output files are **not included** in this repository due to their large size.

These datasets are **available upon request**.
